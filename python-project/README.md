Disclaimer: In order to obtain the dataset samples, the functions actually need to use copyrighted content. Since I don't have any type of permission to distribute that type of data, "Data" and "Images" directories contain data that are not copyrighted restricted and hence they contain data that has not been actually used in the project.

Directories:
- AppModel: after the training procedure, will contain the "GungeonModel.h5" model file.
- Data: contains the json data used by the scripts.
- Images: contains floors and items images used by the scripts.
- Scripts: contains scripts which can help you to use the models.
